Since early 2021, households have lost approximately $2,000 in purchasing power and at least $33,000 in real wealth. Personal savings have decreased by nearly $3 trillion, and credit card balances have reached an all-time high of $1.1 trillion. Housing costs are at their highest in over 30 years, significantly impacting poor and working-class families who spend more of their income on essentials. Additionally, real median household income has fallen short of what it should be when adjusted for inflation, resulting in a loss of nearly $3,000 in real wages since 2019.",
