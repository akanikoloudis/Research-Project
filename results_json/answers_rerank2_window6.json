    "answer": "The financial situation of average households in the United States has worsened over time. Since early 2021, households have lost approximately $2,000 in purchasing power and at least $33,000 in real wealth. Personal savings have decreased by nearly $3 trillion, and credit card balances have reached an all-time high of $1.1 trillion. Additionally, the monthly cost of the median-priced home is at its highest in over 30 years, with low-income families disproportionately spending more of their income on essentials like food and energy.",
