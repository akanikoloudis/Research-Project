For each question in the dataset, it retrieves relevant passages based on the chosen method and feeds them to the LLM to generate an answer. If reranking is enabled, the retrieved passages are refined using a second LLM pass. Retry logic is incorporated to handle potential rate limits, and final answers are saved along with their corresponding metadata for further evaluation."
