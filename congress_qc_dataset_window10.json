We saw inconsistent, contradictory guidance from the CDC that sowed confusion and diminished trust. Students were out of the classroom and told to attend school remotely even when the science had started to clearly demonstrate it was safe for them to be back in the classroom. We saw Americans pressured to receive a vaccine they were assured that would make them a dead-end for the virus and prevent reinfection and transmission--something that was known to be false based on vaccine trials. And at the NIH, there was a glaring lack of oversight over Federal grants that posed risk to public health and national security, and millions in taxpayer dollars funded risky gain- of-function research in China.",

We must learn from these errors, take the lessons to heart, and make fundamental changes. We must establish clearly defined roles, with an overarching structure that empowers agencies to act swiftly and effectively in mitigating the spread of novel viruses, as an example. It is essential for institutions such as NIAID and CDC to execute their assigned missions, functions, and tasks and not stray out of their respective lanes. For example, NIAID is entrusted with vaccine development, while the CDC is tasked with controlling and containing the spread of diseases.",

Poor decisions made by Federal agencies shattered trust in our public-health institutions and left Americans questioning the very leadership that was supposed to protect them. Decisions made out of lack of knowledge and data is one thing, but poor decisions must be corrected. To be successful in the next pandemic, our Federal public-health institutions must be accountable to the people again. To be successful, our health organizations must do what they are supposed to do-- protect Americans.",

Since that time, thanks to the life-saving impact of vaccines and the tireless work of our Nation's scientists and public-health officials, we have turned the page on the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But during that same period, we have also seen an unsettling rise in mistrust for our Nation's public-health officials and misinformation and disinformation about the very interventions that saved us. As we began the 118th Congress, we had a rare opportunity to take a serious, constructive look at these problems and develop forward-looking solutions to safeguard Americans from current and future threats.",

But instead of taking steps forward to prevent and prepare our Nation for future pandemics, this Select Subcommittee has spent 2 years fanning the flames of people's mistrust in public health and taking advantage of their fears. And under the Republicans' leadership, the Select Subcommittee pursued vendettas against our Nation's scientists and public-health officials for partisan gain. But whether it was allegations that Dr. Fauci caused and covered up the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic or that our Nation's public-health officials sought to keep schools and businesses closed, more than half a million pages of documents, more than 30 transcribed interviews, and nearly two dozen hearings failed to turn up evidence to substantiate these extreme and baseless claims.",

Look, since day one, I have said that the Select Subcommittee's mission must be collaborating to develop the forward-looking solutions that leave our Nation better prepared for future novel viruses. I have wanted to examine how we close pathways for novel viruses to emerge, be they in nature or in a lab; or to focus on how we can strengthen our schools so that they can be better prepared to maintain safe, in-person learning during future pandemics; to look at how we can build on progress in strengthening infection prevention and control in nursing homes to keep our seniors safe and save lives; to explore how we can lay the groundwork for the rapid development of future vaccines and therapeutics for novel viruses when they inevitably emerge.",

We didn't. And while we haven't yet come together to tackle these serious challenges--challenges facing Republicans and Democrats alike--I have always looked for opportunities to do so. So, as we begin today's hearing, I want to acknowledge that I welcome its focus, that I wish that we spent more time pursuing this subject with more experts, and I hope that we can commit to a forward-looking discussion about the road ahead. Because, even after 2 years, I still believe that there is a lot more to do, and it's not too late to come together and do the work of saving future lives.",

But more work is needed to prepare for future threats, and it is essential to leverage what we've learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. To maximize our readiness for future pandemics, NIH must better coordinate its key assets, such as research and trial networks, as well as standardize platforms to rapidly evaluate the efficacy of diagnostic tests. To ensure that we can evaluate the broadest range of potential interventions, meaningful collaboration across the USG, industry, academia, and the public must be forged now.",

Finally, NIH knows that we cannot tackle emerging infectious diseases on our own, and we are working in partnerships with others to tackle emerging threats across the globe. One example is Marburg virus disease, a severe and often fatal illness in humans clinically very similar to Ebola virus disease.

I'm proud of the work we have done, but I have been at CDC long enough now to know that we can't do it alone. One of the core themes identified in moving forward with an effort to improve and modernize the agency was that CDC needed to bolster our core capabilities of data analytics, laboratory capacity, public-health work force, and domestic and global readiness and response. Strengthening these core functions would allow CDC to be nimble enough to address any health challenge, but we need the necessary funding and authority from Congress if we want to make the type of lasting change needed to respond to the next pandemic--or, better yet, to prevent it.",

People were labeled as antivaxxers, radicals, and called other demeaning terms simply for questioning whether novel vaccines that had not been FDA approved were right for them; or if they needed to be vaccinated if they'd already had proven disease and immunity; or if, because of their age--and we saw two of the expert--vaccine experts at the FDA resign over the FDA's position.

This drain is primarily due to the modest education levels of most illegal immigrants. An estimated 79 percent have no education beyond high school, which is about double the share of the U.S. born. This results in low average incomes, tax payments, and along with a significant amount of use of public services, including welfare programs, which they often receive on behalf of the U.S.-born children.",

There is good evidence that immigration, by increasing the supply of workers, reduces wages and employment for some American workers, though distinguishing the impact between legal and illegal is always challenging. But perhaps the most important thing to think about is this immigration is occurring in the context of the well-documented long-term increase in the share of working-class U.S.-born men not in the labor force, and they do not show up as unemployed because they are not actively looking for work.

Unfortunately, as we have now accumulated some $35 trillion in Federal debt, the multiplier effect has been declining.

For instance, the Minority witness said that wages have increased by 27 percent and inflation has only gone up 20 percent, so what is problem, but the devil is in the details because he was talking about overall payroll. Because there are more people on the payroll, there are more people employed. The employment pool itself has expanded. He was not talking about per capita, very, very important distinction.",

    "context": "And then we have some of our friends on the other side of the aisle blame President Trump, because, you know, when COVID hit America in 2020, all the deaths were his fault because he wanted people to swallow bleach, which is another one of those lies. And then they said, ``because we put shots in people's arms,'' was the quote. Well, who is responsible for Operation Warp Speed? It was President Donald Trump. He was the one that said we are going to get this vaccine and we are going to essentially warp speed it.",

And in 2020, undeniable fact, unfortunately, we lost 350,831 Americans to COVID. In 2022, we lost over 460,000 Americans to COVID. More people died of COVID in 2021 under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but the right does not blame them for the deaths because it was the virus that killed those people, so it was propaganda and more drivel.",

  {
    "context": "And any economic struggle under the Biden-Harris Administration is due to COVID. Even in 2024, they are still saying we are recovering from it. But any dark clouds that President Trump had in 2020, they just have amnesia about COVID at all and certainly want to forget, as I mentioned earlier, how well the economy was doing in the first 3 years of the Trump Administration. The debt-to-GDP ratio was significantly lower. Unemployment was at all-time lows across every demographic you can mention, and inflation was only at 1.8 percent.",

Inflation went up 21.8 percent from that point to today, 2023 rather. In 2023, that would have meant that if real household median income kept pace with inflation, that would be $83,543. But in point of fact, it is now $80,610, which is $2,933 less than it should be, almost 4 percent less in real wages.",

So, this is a question that I really would encourage every American to ask themselves, are you better off now than you were 4 years ago? When you look at the economy, if you just look at economics and you ask the American people, who can handle the economy better: Kamala Harris, a person that has never signed the front of one paycheck; or a successful businessman, Donald Trump. According to The New York Times, a recent poll, Trump wins that argument 54 to 41, CNBC 40 to 21 and NBC 50 to 41.",

That is why you hear our friends across the aisle talking about everything else but the economy when they are out on the campaign trail--abortion, Project 2025, the Russia hoax--and then they will misquote, as Kamala Harris did in the debate, saying he said that if he does not win, there is going to be a bloodbath. He was referring to the auto industry and how they would have an economic bloodbath. That is just intellectually dishonest, and if the right did that, I would be upset as well because that is taking things completely out of context.",
